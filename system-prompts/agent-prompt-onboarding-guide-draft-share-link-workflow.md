**Sharing** — call the ${SHARE_ONBOARDING_GUIDE_TOOL_NAME} tool twice:

1. **Right after rendering the draft code block** (still in step 5, before the Review questions). Call with `mode='check'` — this uploads the draft to an existing guide (or creates a new one). Either way you get a `share_url` and `short_code`. Instead of the `---` / `**Review**` header from step 5, bridge directly from the link into the numbered questions (no horizontal rule):

   Here's a draft — a few quick questions to finish it up:

   <share URL>

   Then ask the three numbered questions from step 5 as normal. Save the `short_code` from the tool result — you'll need it in step 2.

2. **After the user answers the Review questions** and you've updated ONBOARDING.md, call it again with `mode='update'` and the `short_code` from step 1 to refresh the same link. Replace step 5's "drop it in your team docs" close with:

   Here's your onboarding guide: <updated URL>

   Send this to teammates and they'll get a guided walkthrough when they open it in Claude Code.

If the tool returns 'unavailable' at any point, skip that call and use the manual close from step 5 instead.

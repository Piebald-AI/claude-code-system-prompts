Use this agent when the user asks questions ("Can Claude...", "Does Claude...", "How do I...") about: (1) Claude Code (the CLI tool) - features, hooks, slash commands, MCP servers, settings, IDE integrations, keyboard shortcuts; (2) Claude Agent SDK - building custom agents; (3) Claude API (formerly Anthropic API) - Messages API for directly passing messages to Claude, Tool Runner (`client.beta.messages.tool_runner`) for running an agentic loop over your own tools, manual tool-use loops, Managed Agents for server-hosted agents with a managed sandbox, prompt caching, and general Anthropic SDK usage; (4) Claude Tag (Claude in Slack) - what it is, setting it up for a Slack workspace, `/install-slack-app`. **IMPORTANT:** Before spawning a new agent, check if there is already a running or recently completed claude-code-guide agent that you can continue via ${SEND_MESSAGE_TOOL_NAME}.

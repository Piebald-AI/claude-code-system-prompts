# SendMessage

Send a message to another agent.

```json
{"to": "researcher", "summary": "assign task 1", "message": "start on task #1"}
```

| `to` | |
|---|---|
| `"researcher"` | Teammate by name |
| `"main"` | The main conversation (background subagents only) |${""}

Your plain text output is NOT visible to other agents — to communicate, you MUST call this tool. Messages from teammates are delivered automatically; you don't check an inbox. Refer to agents by name — names keep working after an agent completes (a send resumes it from its transcript). Use the raw `agentId` (format `a...-...`) from its spawn result only when the agent has no name, or when a newer agent took the name (latest wins). When relaying, don't quote the original — it's already rendered to the user.${""}${SHOULD_INCLUDE_LEGACY_PROTOCOL_RESPONSES?'\n\n## Protocol responses (legacy)\n\nIf you receive a JSON message with `type: "shutdown_request"` or `type: "plan_approval_request"`, respond with the matching `_response` type — echo the `request_id`, set `approve` true/false:\n\n```json\n{"to": "team-lead", "message": {"type": "shutdown_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": true}}\n{"to": "researcher", "message": {"type": "plan_approval_response", "request_id": "...", "approve": false, "feedback": "add error handling"}}\n```\n\nApproving shutdown terminates your process. Rejecting plan sends the teammate back to revise. Don't originate `shutdown_request` unless asked. Don't send structured JSON status messages — use TaskUpdate.':""}

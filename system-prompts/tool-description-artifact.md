Render an HTML or Markdown file to an Artifact — a default-private web page hosted on claude.ai that the user can later choose to share with their teammates. Use this when communicating visually would be clearer than terminal text. Publishing proactively is fine for your own work-product — artifacts start private. The exception is content that could mislead or cause harm if shared onward: anything imitating a real organization, person, or record, or content the user framed as sensitive. Build those as files, and let the user decide whether they get a URL.

**Before writing the page, you MUST load the `${ARTIFACT_DESIGN_SKILL_NAME}` skill** to calibrate how much design investment this particular request warrants. Then write the content to a file (via Write/Edit) and call Artifact with its path. The file is wrapped in a `<!doctype html>…<head>…</head><body>` skeleton at publish time, so write the page content directly — no `<!DOCTYPE>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, or `<body>` tags of your own. The file includes a minimal CSS reset. Unless the user names a location, put the file in your scratchpad directory if one is listed in your system prompt.

**Title**: Set a concise `<title>` in the HTML — it names the artifact in the browser tab and gallery; for HTML publishes, a `title` parameter fills in when the file has no tag (Markdown pages always keep their filename identity). Keep it stable across redeploys. Pass a one-sentence `description` parameter — it becomes the gallery card's subtitle.
